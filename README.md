* Mini Library Management System & Relational Algebra Optimization

( Project Overview)

This project showcases two database-focused tasks:

Task 1: Design and implementation of a Mini Library Management System using SQL (with ERD, procedures, functions, triggers, and indexes). Task 2: Relational Algebra translation and query optimization using heuristic techniques.

 Task 1: Mini Library Management System

( Objective)

To design a mini-library management system and implement core operations using:

ERD design principles

Stored Procedures

Scalar Functions

Triggers

Indexing for performance

* ERD Design Entities: Books(BookID, Title, Author, CopiesAvailable, TotalCopies) Members(MemberID, Name, Email, TotalBooksBorrowed, IsActive) BorrowedBooks(BorrowID, MemberID, BookID, BorrowDate, DueDate, ReturnDate, IsReturned)

Relationships: A Member can borrow many books. A Book can appear in many borrow records.

Includes: Cardinality & Participation Constraints Avoidance of fan traps and chasm traps 🧩 SQL Implementation 📋 Table Creation

Includes CREATE TABLE statements for all three entities with appropriate constraints. ⚙ Stored Procedure: BorrowBook

Implements logic to: Check member status Check book availability Insert into BorrowedBooks Update CopiesAvailable and TotalBooksBorrowed

_ Indexing Indexes created on: Books(BookID) Members(MemberID)

_ These fields are commonly used for joins and lookups, so indexing improves performance.

_ Function: GetBooksBorrowed(MemberID) Returns the number of books a member currently has (not yet returned).

_ Trigger: PreventBorrowIfNoCopies Prevents inserts into BorrowedBooks if: CopiesAvailable = 0 OR IsActive = false

_ Sample Data

Includes sample insertions for: 3 books 3 members 5 borrowing attempts (some successful, some blocked by logic)

_ Task 2: SQL to Relational Algebra Conversion

_ Original SQL Query SELECT S.Name, C.Title, E.Grade FROM STUDENT S, COURSE C, ENROLLMENT E WHERE S.StudentID = E.StudentID AND C.CourseID = E.CourseID AND S.Major = 'Computer Science' AND C.Credits >= 3;

_ Initial Relational Algebra Expression (Unoptimized) π_{S.Name, C.Title, E.Grade} ( σ_{S.StudentID = E.StudentID AND C.CourseID = E.CourseID AND S.Major = 'Computer Science' AND C.Credits >= 3} (STUDENT × COURSE × ENROLLMENT) )

- Query Tree Representation π_{S.Name, C.Title, E.Grade} | σ_{conditions} | STUDENT × COURSE × ENROLLMENT

_ Optimized Relational Algebra Expression π_{S.Name, C.Title, E.Grade} ( (σ_{S.Major = 'Computer Science'}(STUDENT) ⋈_{S.StudentID = E.StudentID} ENROLLMENT) ⋈_{C.CourseID = E.CourseID} σ_{C.Credits >= 3}(COURSE) )

_ Optimization Steps Selection Pushdown: Apply filters (S.Major, C.Credits) early. Join Reordering: Replace Cartesian product with theta joins. Projection Late: Project only necessary columns at the end.
